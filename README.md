# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera


![](/resources/Certification.png)

This repository contains my coursework and projects completed during the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) offered by UCSan Diego. 

The specialization is a comprehensive program designed to provide a deep understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, along with their applications in solving real-world problems.
